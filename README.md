# COBOL Experiments

These are a few of my experiments in learning COBOL.

### Usage

I compile and run these on Ubuntu 18.04 using
OpenCOBOL, which you can install by running:

`sudo apt-get install open-cobol`

Compile one of these scripts by running:

`cobc -x -o hello hello.cob`

Finally, run:

```
./hello
Hello world!
```
